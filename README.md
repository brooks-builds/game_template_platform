# What to work on

- Store entities into HashMaps and convert the grid to store the id's of the entities and where they are in the world.
- Fix query so that camera can get all of the entities that need to be drawn
- have all platforms draw as one mesh
- Only check the collidable entities near the player each update tick
- Implement partialeq manually on entity
- Create error enum to use in the game
